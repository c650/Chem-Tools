# Chem-Tools
Because I had to do a high school chemistry lab that needed error, deviation, and standard deviation, I decided to write a Ruby program to do this for me -- because, you know, why not?

## Instructions
*YOU NEED THE TERMINAL FOR THIS*

Simple download the zip file, extract, and

	cd /path/to/file

Then, 

	ruby application_controller.rb

And follow the instructions.
