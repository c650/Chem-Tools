# Chem-Tools # v0.0.3
Because I had to do a high school chemistry lab that needed error, deviation, and standard deviation, I decided to write a Ruby program to do this for me -- because, you know, why not?

Anyways, here it is.

## Instructions
<strong>YOU NEED THE TERMINAL FOR THIS</strong>

Simply download the zip file, extract, and

	cd /path/to/file

Then, 

	ruby chem-tools.rb

And follow the instructions.

The methods/math is in the methods.rb file. The chem-tools.rb file handles the program flow.
